        following:
      </p>
      <p style={{ ...textStyle, marginLeft: "24px" }}>
        7.2.1 limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents,

      <p style={{ ...textStyle, marginLeft: "24px" }}>
        7.2.2 implementing procedures for dealing with data breaches (the
        accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
        disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you

      <p style={textStyle}>
        7.5 We may store or transfer some or all of your personal data to
        countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”
        consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and
        Liechtenstein). These including the United Kingdom are known as “third
        countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as
        those in the EEA. This means that We will endeavour to take additional
        steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as
        safely and securely as it would be under the Data Protection Regulation
        as follows:
      </p>
      <p style={textStyle}>

        group ensures that personal data is protected by requiring all companies
        within the group to follow the same rules with respect to personal data
        usage. These are known as “binding corporate rules”.
      </p>
      <p style={textStyle}>
        7.5.2 We may share your data with external third parties that are based
        outside of the United Kingdom or the EEA. The following safeguards are

      <p style={textStyle}>
        7.5.2.1 We will only transfer your personal data to third countries
        whose levels of data protection are deemed ‘adequate’ by the European
        Commission.
      </p>
      <p style={textStyle}>
        7.5.2.2 We use specific contracts with external third parties that are
        approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to
        third countries. These contracts require the same levels of personal
        data protection that would apply under the Data Protection Legislation.
      </p>
      <p style={textStyle}>
        7.6 Please contact us using the contact details below in Part 14 for
